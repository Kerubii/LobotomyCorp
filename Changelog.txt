Version 0.7.7 - Minor fixes
Changes
-Made Lobcorp EGO more Terraria, ill just make them work ala lobcorp when Qlipoth Detterence is implemented
-I've found out that im an idiot on making up recipes, reduced a lot of items required for recipes and made them more easily acquired
-Damage is also changed to be based on their recipes
-Changed a lot of the damage to befit their point in progression, Spears now have their intended damage after not noticing for too long...
-Compressed sound files because I forgot so the mod isnt at, like, 70+ mb (Its now a 20mb)
