# .hjson files contain translations for the language specified in the filename. (Make sure this file is UTF-8 encoded only.)

				Story: {
					1: It takes the form of a girl burnt to ashes. Even though there's nothing left to burn, the fire still doesn't extinguish.
					2: A matchstick impales the girl's body like a stake. Usually, the match is always lit, while the Abnormality shows no sign of activity. Because of this, employees often speculate that the matchstick may be the Abnormality's true body. However, recently, the ashen figure was seen crying, according to witnesses.
					3: Excerpt from Abnormality Specialist Doctor <Redacted>�s Research Log> \n"The charred body represents the child's crumbled hope, while the ever blazing flame represents the obsession for affection. It's always in conflict with the contradiction between these two.� �We paid a boatload and that's all they have to say?
					4: <Excerpt from Recorded Staff Conversation>\n"Well, she�s like a ticking time bomb. No one can tell if she�s in a good mood or not. We just hope that we won�t be the one blown up before entering the Containment Unit. She won�t get any better, we can only try and keep her from getting worse."
					5: <Excerpt from Counseling Log>  "I never thought the abnormality would be able to escape. Maybe we were getting careless, but it seemed that all it could do was burn up the match stuck in its body. Yes, our response was a bit late. (Omitted) Most Abnormalities that try to escape would attack the employees in front of them, but this one didn't show any aggression toward the nearby employees. Instead, it headed to a different department, the most crowded place in the company. If we didn't suppress it at the door, half of the people here wouldn't be in one piece.

				Name: One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds

				Story: {
					1:
						'''
						A silent Abnormality that understands the conflict between good and evil. Its empty eye sockets stare at all those who encounter it.
						A giant skull that is attached to a cross, it wears a crown of thorns.&#10;It floats about 2 meters above the ground.
						'''
					2: While its appearance is bizarre, it is rare to record an incident of violence against employees involving this Abnormality.
					3:
						'''
						It feeds on the "evil" that seeps out during conversations between people. The assigned employee must kneel before it (standing appears to be acceptable) and present their "evil" by confessing their sins to it. The way it feeds is unknown.

						<Excerpt from Experiment Records>
						We have cataloged the sins a person can commit into three levels.
						Level 1: A small lie or action that either goes unnoticed or can be shared in jest.
						Level 2: Sins that are more serious and only shared with the closest of friends.
						Level 3: Sins so profound that they cannot be shared with anyone. These will be taken to the grave.
						Employee <Redacted> had been assigned to confess a Level 1 sin. Energy production via the Abnormality increased by 12%.
						Employee <Redacted> was assigned to confess a Level 2 sin. Energy production via the Abnormality increased by 15%.
						We assigned employee <Redacted> to confess a Level 3 sin. 1 minute and 48 seconds after the employee was sent in, a bright flash of light was seen. The light was so bright that it could be seen outside of the Containment Unit. Immediately following the light, there was a facility-wide power outage. The phenomena lasted for 2 hours. Employee <Redacted> lost 6 years of their memory.
						Further experiments were canceled. Scientific ethics decree that all footage of those who participated in the experiment is to be kept sealed. However, the incident left us no choice but to review the footage of the Containment Unit.
						'''
					4:
						'''
						Employee <Redacted>: "This happened during <Redacted> at around 4:00 PM. Anyways, there was a railway about 20 minutes from my house. Some of my good friends and I decided to dress as forest animals. One of us chose to go as a deer. It was a crude costume, it could hardly be called one to be honest. Just a pair of clumsily made antlers and a dark outfit with some deer-like spots on it. (Omitted)

						I don't know how our �deer� friend wandered into the woods. We didn't even notice he was missing for maybe an hour. We searched for him and finally found him in some bushes. We called out his name, and I'm not sure if it was from relief of finally finding us or what but he started sprinting towards us.
						And that's when we heard it; the gunshots. Bang! Bang! Bang! When I came to my senses, I saw his blood splattered all the way to my feet. After that, not one of us dressed up as an animal ever again. That�s all. By the way, is this really supposed to work?"

						<Observation Log #4_435>
						"Its eye sockets are empty. It is a skull after all. But I doubt it�s blind. It certainly has its gaze fixed on me, and I can somehow feel that it�s listening to me. Confessing to it does lighten my heart, admittedly."
						'''
					5:
						'''
						Afterwards, we investigated the incident in the employee�s hometown to get a better picture. We learned that a boy named Justin was shot and killed in a deer costume by hunters during hunting season. Unlike the employee�s confession, Justin was repeatedly bullied by other kids. Witnesses said they heard the kids shout �Run Justin, run!" right before the gunshot. After the incident, the kids at the scene moved out of town, and deer hunting was banned in the area."

						<Excerpt from Abnormality Research Log X-392>
						"Honestly, you can�t expect all of our employees to give honest confessions to that skull. Around every one in ten employees will tend to say something that is not completely true. It�s a bit different from a lie. You can say that it�s a subconscious excuse they make.
						They distort perspectives to justify their actions, even though they are aware that they should be telling the truth. Once this happens, the confession is no longer truly a confession. Yes, I�m talking about you trying to justify your tardiness for 5 minutes now!
